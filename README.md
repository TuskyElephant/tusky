# Tusky the Elephant
Tusky is a normal elephant with grey fur and a trunk. He has fur because a) I say she has fur and b) she's a soft toy.

So yeah.

## Tusky's friends
Tusky has lots of friends, and they aren't all necessarily elephants...

His best friends is Pengui Rainbow and his second best fried is Blue Elephant, a blue Jellycat.

He has many more friends, of all shapes and sizes (and prices...)

Tucky, one of his bigger friends is very big a cute, costing a whopping £60!

His cheapest friend, Armband Elephant, only cose £3 and was bought in China. Well, in China is was 300 HKD and that is equivalent to £3 so yeah.

Pengui was £9.99 (I think), Jelly Elephant was £24 (I think as well) and Giggle elephant was, I dunno.
